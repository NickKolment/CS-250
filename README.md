CS 250 Sprint Review and Retrospective Project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  You find out users needs by asking them through different interview methods. There can be online surveys, in person group discussions, personal interviews and any other ways you can think of to gather the information. User stories help by giving you the users point of view and ideas on the system.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Theres two main methods of developing a program. The waterfall method and agile methods. Waterfall is a more direct process which would be best for a smaller project with no changes made during the development. Agile methods such as Scrum are more flexible and better suited for projects where changes may be made during development. I would hope to use agile methods to develop programs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member does their part. They help other team members and ask for assistance when they need it.
